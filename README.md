# Description

This project is made by following [Traversy Media's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyei2iDA4Hs&list=PLillGF-RfqbbRA-CIUxlxkUpbq0IFkX60). When I followed the project, I already had a basic idea of Django and React/Redux. However, the project is getting old and doesn't use functional components or hooks, in the 'functional' branch, I have implemented these to the best of my ability.
